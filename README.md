# Ferret Images

Collection of ferret images

## Contributing

- All contributed images will be transformed to a JPG under 300kb, as standard with [dog.ceo's image collection](https://github.com/jigsawpieces/dog-api-images).
- Ensure your photos are of a good quality and the ferret is easily identifiable in the photo
- Ensure your photo features one ferret only (although additional ferrets can be in the background)
- Photos must not represent any human, even human body parts; it's illegal in most states of the world

## Layout

`/collection/<uuid>`:
- `image.json` - metadata for the ferret image
- `image.jpg` - the actual image itself
